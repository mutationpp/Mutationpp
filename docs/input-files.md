## Introduction
<a id="top"></a>

The data files distributed with Mutation++ are located in one of the subdirectories under the __data__ directory as follows:

- __data__
  + __mechanisms__ chemical [reaction mechanisms](#reaction-mechanisms)
  + __mixtures__ [mixture definitions](#mixtures)
  + __thermo__ [elemental](#elements) and species [thermodynamic databases](#thermodynamic-databases)
  + __transfer__ internal energy [transfer model databases](#transfer-databases)
  + __transport__ @subpage collisions "collision integral database"
  + __gsi__ gas-surface interaction mechanism

### File location
<a id="file-location"></a>

Mutation++ is aware of its `data_directory`. It defaults to the `MPP_DATA_DIRECTORY` environment variable, which should have been setup during the [installation](#installation) of Mutation++ and usually points to the aforementioned data directory.

In addition, Mutation++ is aware of the `working_directory`, where an executable that utilizes Mutation++ is being run. [Mixture files](#mixtures) may also be in the working directory.

When a data file `name`.`ext` is requested, Mutation++ searches for it looking up locations in the following order:
1. `working_directory`/`name`.`ext`
2. `working_directory`/`dir`/`name`.`ext`
3. `data_directory`/`name`.`ext`
4. `data_directory`/`dir`/`name`.`ext`

where `dir` is any subdirectory. In practice, it allows a user to supersede a default data file with their own, by simply locating it in the working directory.

### Simplified XML Language
<a id="xml-language"></a>

Many of these files are written in a simplified version of the Extensible Markup
Language (XML).  XML provides a human readable, yet complex and extensible format for data
to be stored with only a few, limited rules.  An example XML fragment is shown below.

```xml
<!-- Comment string -->
<root_tag attribute="value">
    <child1_tag>
        text
    </child1_tag>
    <child2_tag attribute="another value" />
</root_tag>
```

An XML document begins with a _root element_.  Every _element_ (or _node_) must begin
with a _tag_ that identifies what type of element it is.  The root element depicted in
the example is of type `root_tag`.  Every element also ends with an _end-tag_
which signifies the end of the element.  Each element may have as many _attribute_ / _value
pairs_ as is desired following the element's tag.  Each pair must consist of an attribute
name followed by an equal sign and the value of the attribute in quotations.

Between the tag and end-tag of an element, an element may also contain one or more _child elements_ or _text_ (but not both).  From the figure, the root element contains two child elements named `child1_tag` and `child2_tag`.  Note that the first child element is an example of an element which contains text instead of more child elements.  The second child element is an example of a short-hand format for elements which only contain attributes.  For such elements, a full end-tag is not necessary.  Instead, simply putting `/>` after the attribute list is sufficient to end the element.  Finally, _comments_ can be inserted anywhere outside of element tags.  Comment strings begin with `<!--` and end with `-->` and can be spread over multiple lines.


## Mixtures
<a id="mixtures"></a>

Mixture files are located in the `data/mixtures` directory.  They are the primary
input mode in Mutation++ because they provide the list of species to be loaded as
well as any options that can be used to control the behavior of Mutation++.

```xml
<!-- Example mixture file -->
<mixture thermo_db="RRHO">
    <!-- Species list -->
    <species>
        N2 N2+ N N+ e-
    </species>
</mixture>
```

### Mixture Options
<a id="mixture-options"></a>

The following options are available as attributes in the `mixture` element.  If an attribute is not given, then the __bold value__ is taken as the __default__.

Attribute              | Possible Values                                     | Description
-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------
`mechanism`            | __none__, name                                      | name of [reaction mechanism](#reaction_mechanisms)
`thermal_conductivity` | `CG`, __LDLT__, `Wilke`                             | choice of heavy particle translational thermal conductivity algorithm
`thermo_db`            | __RRHO__, `NASA-7`, `NASA-9`                        | choice of [thermodynamic database](#thermodynamic_databases)
`state_model`          | __ChemNonEq1T__, `ChemNonEqTTv`, `Equil`, `EquilTP` | choice of [state model](#statemodels)
`use_transport`        | `no`, __yes__                                       | whether or not to load transport data
`viscosity`            | `CG`, `Gupta-Yos`, __LDLT__, `Wilke`                | choice of viscosity algorithm

### Species List Descriptor
<a id="species-list-descriptor"></a>

A _species list descriptor_ tells Mutation++ which species to load from the chosen
thermodynamic database.  The simplest version of a descriptor is a list of species
names separated by white space as in the example mixture above.

A species list can also contain a more generic descriptor which allows the user to
choose species based on a given set of rules.  For now, the rule simply allows
to choose all species in a particular category which contain certain elements from a
list.  The format for this descriptor is

```
{ category with element_list }
```

where `category` can be one of the following strings:
- `gases` selects from all gases in the database
- `liquids` selects from all liquids in the database
- `solids` selects from all solids in the database
- `condensed` combines `liquids` and `solids`
- __all__ selects from all species in the database

The `element_list` should be a comma-separated list of [element names](#elements).
A rule can also be combined with a list of species names.  For example, if you
want a mixture with all gas species containing the elements C,H,O and graphite, the
species node would look like the following:

```xml
<species>
    {gases with C,H,O,e-} C(gr)
<species>
```

Note that the electron is also included in the above example.  This allows ions in
the mixture because they are treated as species with the fake "electron element"
(see the [Elements](#elements) section for more details).

**Species Names** <br>

Species names given in any data file, must obey the following rules:
- the characters `"`, `{`, `}`, `=`, `<`, `>`, and spaces are __not allowed__
- the first character __cannot be__ a numeric digit
- placing `(#)` (where `#` represents a whole number) at the end of a name indicates the
  `#`<sup>th</sup> electronic energy level of that species.
  + example: `N2(3)` is the 4<sup>th</sup> electronic level of N<sub>2</sub> because
    the index begins at 0
  + note that this only works if the thermodynamic database being used includes
    electronic energy levels for that species

**Species Order** <br>
<a id="species-order"></a>

A list of species __may not be__ represented internally in Mutation++ in the same order they
are specified in the species list descriptor.  Mutation++ places the species in an order which makes indexing the species the most convenient.  In general, the following steps are taken to order the species:
1. if present, the electron is placed at the beginning of the list
2. gas species are placed in front of condensed phase species
3. if electronic states are specified for any species, they are expanded in place
4. finally, species take the order given in the [list descriptor](#species-list-descriptor)

A good way to see how the species are actually ordered in Mutation++ is to check the
mixture with the [checkmix](checkmix.md) program.

### Named Elemental Compositions
<a id="elemental-compositions"></a>
Named elemental compositions can be included in the mixture file which can then
be retrieved inside Mutation++.  Many of the tools included with Mutation++ can also use this information to simplify input on the command line.  An example of a list of element compositions for the 11-species Air mixture are shown below.

```xml
<element_compositions default="air1">
    <composition name="air1"> e-:0.0, N:0.79, O: 0.21 </composition>
    <composition name="air2"> e-:0.0, N:0.80, O: 0.20 </composition>
</element_compositions>
```

Note that if the `default` attribute is used as above, the composition with the
name in the `default` value will be use as the default composition when computing
equilibrium calculations.  If no default is specified, then the first composition is used by default.


## Elements
<a id="elements"></a>

Element names and molecular weights are stored in the `elements.xml` file in the
`data/thermo` directory.  Each element is given as an XML node in the file.  An
example of the Nitrogen XML node is given as

```xml
<!-- Nitrogen -->
<element name="N">
    <mw units="g/mol">14.0067</mw>
</element>
```

__Note that the electron is treated like an element in Mutation++ and should not be
changed__ in the `elements.xml` file.  In general, most of the known elements are
already given in `elements.xml` and it is unlikely that it should need to be
modified.

## Reaction Mechanisms
<a id="reaction-mechanisms"></a>

A mechanism name referenced in a mixture file will correspond to a file with an .xml
extension in the mechanisms directory.  A mechanism file describes a reaction mechanism
which is a set of elementary reactions.

Mechanism files begin with a root element called `mechanism`.  A `name` attribute may be
given but it is ignored.  The name of the mechanism is determined by the filename (without
the `.xml` extension).

The root `mechanism` element may have any number of child elements which correspond to
__reaction elements__ or __unit specifiers__.

### Reaction Definitions
<a id="reaction-definitions"></a>

Below is an example `reaction` element
```xml
<reaction formula="N2+M=2N+M">
    <arrhenius A="7.0E+21" n="-1.6" T="113200." />
    <M>N2:3,N:4</M>
</reaction>
```

`reaction` elements must contain a `formula` attribute which specifies the reaction
formula for the given reaction.  The `formula` string must obey the following rules:
- species names are separated by the `+` symbol
- an `M` in the reactant and product lists indicate a thirdbody reaction (note that this
  character is reserved and cannot be a species name)
- stoichiometric coefficients must directly precede a species name (if the coefficient is
  a `1`, then it can be left out)
- reactants and products must be separated by one of the following
  + `=` indicates a reversible reaction
  + `=>` indicates an irreversible reaction
- __a maximum of 3 reactants and products are allowed__

If the reaction is a thirdbody reaction, thirdbody efficiency factors can be specified in
a `M` child node of the `reaction` element.  The `M` text should be a list of of
colon-separated pairs of species names and efficiency factor, each separated by commas
such as in the example above.  __Any efficiency factors which are not specified default to__
__a value of 1.  Free electrons do not participate in thirdbody reactions.__

**Rate Laws** <br>

A `reaction` element __must contain a child node which describes which rate law to use__
when evaluating the forward rate coefficient.  The rate law node is specified by the tag
and its corresponding attributes correspond to the parameters for that given rate law.  The
following rate rate laws are currently supported.

- `arrhenius`  $`k(T) = A\, T^n\, \exp \left( \frac{-E_a}{R_u T} \right)`$

Att. | Value
-----|--------
`A`  | pre-exponential factor
`n`  | temperature exponent
`Ea` | activation energy
`T`  | characteristic temperature $`E_a / R_u`$

_note: only one of `Ea` or `T` may be used, not both_

### Unit Specifiers
<a id="unit-specifiers"></a>

A unit specifier element is used to specify the units of the parameters in each rate law
if needed.  A unit specifier element is denoted by a tag which has `_units` appended to
the rate law tag (ie: `arrhenius_units`).  Unit specifiers can be placed anywhere in a
reaction mechanism and will apply to all rate laws of that type for reactions listed after
the unit specifier.  The attributes of the unit specifier element correspond to the
parameters of the rate law.  Some parameters need units specified for several physical
quantities (such as mass, length, time, etc.).  These will be separated by commas.

- `arrhenius_units`

Att. | Value                               | Description
-----|-------------------------------------|-------------
`A`  | quantity, length, time, temperature | units of pre-exponential factor
`E`  | energy, quantity, temperature       | units of activation energy and characteristic temperature

### Example Mechanism
<a id="example-mechanism"></a>

As an example of how to create a mechanism file, consider the following example reaction
mechanism for a 5-species Nitrogen mixture of N2, N2+, N, N+ and e- with each reaction
controlled by an Arrhenius rate law.

\# | Formula                                  | A [mol,cm,s,K] | n     | Ea [K]
---|------------------------------------------|----------------|-------|--------
1  | N2 + N2 <-> 2N + N2     | 1.0e21         | -1.6  | 113200
2  | N2 + N <-> 2N + N       | 3.0e21         | -1.6  | 113200
3  | N2 + N^+ <-> 2N + N+    | 1.0e21         | -1.6  | 113200
4  | N2 + e- <-> 2N + e-     | 7.0e22         | -1.6  | 113200
5  | N + e- <-> N+ + e- + e- | 2.5e30         | -3.82 | 168200
6  | N + N <-> N2+ + e-      | 4.4e7          | 1.5   | 67500

Reactions 1-4 in the above example have the same rate constants except for the
pre-exponential factor differ only by the thirdbody species, making them good candidates
to combine into a generic thirdbody reaction with efficiency factors.  However, free
electrons cannot be thirdbodies in Mutation++, so reaction 4 must be treated separately.
Note also that N2+ is not a possible thirdbody in reactions 1-4, thus its efficiency
factor should be zero.  The remaining reactions, 5-6, should be specified normally.  The
resulting mechanism file `example.xml` is given below.

```xml
<!-- Example mechanism for 5-species N2 mix -->
<mechanism name="example">

    <arrhenius_units A="mol,cm,s,K" E="kcal,mol,K" />

    <!-- # 1-3 -->
    <reaction formula="N2+M=2N+M">
        <arrhenius A="1.0E+21" n="-1.6" T="113200." />
        <M> N:3, N2+:0 </M>
    </reaction>

    <!-- # 4 -->
    <reaction formula="N2+e-=2N+e-">
        <arrhenius A="7.0E+22" n="-1.6" T="113200." />
    </reaction>

    <!-- # 5 -->
    <reaction formula="N+e-=N++e-+e-">
        <arrhenius A="2.5E+30" n="-3.82" T="168200." />
    </reaction>

    <!-- # 6 -->
    <reaction formula="N+N=N2++e-">
        <arrhenius A="4.4E+07" n="+1.50" T="67500." />
    </reaction>

</mechanism>
```

## Collision Integral Database
<a id="collision-integrals"></a>

_This is a work in in progress._

### Introduction
<a id="collisions_intro"></a>

The collision integral database is provided in the `data/transport/collisions.xml` file.
This page documents how collision integral data is stored and configured.  In particular,
- how to define [collision pairs](#collisions_pairs),
- how to use different [collision integral models](#collisions_types),
- how to tune the [default behavior](#collisions_defaults),
- how to specify [global options](#collisions_global_options),
- and finally, how to provide [species-specific data](#collisions_species_data) needed
  for some collision integral models.

All collision integral databases must be contained within a `collisions` XML element as
follows.
```xml
<collisions>
    <!-- All data corresponding to collision pairs and integrals go here -->
</collisions>
```

### Defining collision pairs
<a id="collisions_pairs"></a>

The most basic node type which can be given as a child of `collisions` is a `pair`
node, which specifies an individual collision pair.
```xml
<pair s1="first species name" s2="second species name">
    <!-- Specify models for each collision integral kind here -->
</pair>
```
The `pair` node has two attributes, `s1` and `s2`, which are the names of the two
interacting species in the pair.  Child nodes can then be given which provide the
data necessary to compute any of the collision integrals for that pair.  The format
of the collision integral nodes is described next.

### Collision integral types
<a id="collisions_types"></a>

Specific collision integral data are provided as XML nodes with the node tag as the
name of the collision integral kind.  For example, to specify the $`\overline{Q}^{(1,1)}``$integral for the N-O interaction pair, use
```xml
<pair s1="N" s2="O">
    <Q11 type="model" />
</pair>
```
where the `type` attribute is the collision integral model to use.  The attributes and
possible child nodes or text needed in the collision integral XML node depends on the
type of model being used.
The following table summarizes the various collision integral types which are
available.  Additional information, including their respective XML format, can
be found in the following subsections.

type              | Description

`Murphy`          | Implements Eq. (5) of [Murphy (1995)](bibliography.md#Murphy1995) for combining elastic and inelastic interactions
`Pirani`          | Implements the Pirani potential, using the approximate curve-fits of [Laricchiuta et al. (2007)](bibliography.md#Laricchiuta2007)
`ratio`           | Ratio of another integral
`table`           | Tabulated data
`warning`         | Prints a warning if used

Regardless of the `type`, all collision integral nodes can specify the following
attributes.

Attribute  | Description
-----------|------------
`accuracy` | The estimated accuracy of the integral in percent off true value
`multpi`   | (`yes` or `no`) Should the integral be multiplied by $`\pi`$?
`ref`      | A reference for the data
`units`    | The units of the integral provided by the data

Note that while theoretically any name can be used as a tag for specifying collision
integrals, the following names are reserved for use within the various transport
algorithms: `Q11`, `Q12`, `Q13`, `Q14`, `Q15`, `Q22`, `Q23`, `Q24`, `Ast`, `Bst`, and
`Cst`.

The following code snippet taken from the `collisions.xml` file provided with the library
shows the specification of the collision integrals needed for the N2-N2 interaction.
```xml
<pair s1="N2" s2="N2">
    <Q11 type="table" units="K,Å-Å" multpi="yes" ref="Wright2005" accuracy="10">
            300   600  1000  2000  4000  6000  8000 10000,
          12.23 10.60  9.79  8.60  7.49  6.87  6.43  6.06 </Q11>
    <Q22 type="table" units="K,Å-Å" multpi="yes" ref="Wright2005" accuracy="10">
            300   600  1000  2000  4000  6000  8000 10000,
          13.72 11.80 10.94  9.82  8.70  8.08  7.58  7.32 </Q22>
</pair>
```

Note that the values of B* and C* which are also need for the neutral-neutral interaction
are not shown because they are specified through [default behaviour](#collisions_defaults).

```

#### Bruno-Eq(19)

```

#### constant

```

#### Debye-Huckel
<a id="collision_types_debye_huckel"></a>

Models interactions between charged particles using the screened Coulomb potential
shielded by the Debye length, known as the Debye-Huckle potential.  The tables of
precomputed collision integrals provided by [Mason, Munn, and Smith (1967)](bibliography.md#Mason1967)
and [Devoto (1973)](bibliography.md#Devoto1973) are used to implement the integrals.  The following
code snippet shows how to use this model.
```xml
<Q11 type="Debye-Huckel"/>
```
Note the actual value of the integral will depend on the kind of collision integral
(or ratio) such as `Q11` or `Ast` and whether or not the interaction is repulsive
or attractive.

#### exp-poly
<a id="collision_types_exp_poly"></a>

Implements an exponential polynomial curve-fit expression of the form
```math
\overline{Q}^{(l,s)}_{i,j}(T) = \exp\big(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i x^i \big),
```
where $`a_i`$ are given coefficients and $`x = \ln(T)`$.  The following XML
snippet shows how to format the coefficients in the database.
```xml
<Q11 type="exp-poly">
    -4.942712e-03 1.113337e-01 -9.844008e-01 6.435295e+00
</Q11>
```
Note that the **coefficients are given in reverse order** and any number of
coefficients can be used.

#### from A*
<a id="collision_types_from_A"></a>

Uses relationship $`A^{*}_{ij} = \overline{Q}^{(2,2)}_{i,j} / \overline{Q}^{(1,1)}_{i,j}`$
to compute either $`A^{*}_{ij}`$,
$`\overline{Q}^{(1,1)}_{i,j}`$, or $`\overline{Q}^{(2,2)}_{i,j}`$, given
the other two.  Simply use the `from A*` type for the missing integral, as in
```xml
<Q11 type="from A*"/>
```
and provide concrete types for the other two.

#### from B*
<a id="collision_types_from_B"></a>

Uses relationship $`B^{*}_{ij} = (5\overline{Q}^{(1,2)}_{i,j} - 4 \overline{Q}^{(1,3)}_{i,j})/\overline{Q}^{(1,1)}_{i,j}`$
to compute either $`B^{*}_{ij}`$, $`\overline{Q}^{(1,1)}_{i,j}`$, $`\overline{Q}^{(1,2)}_{i,j}`$,
or $`\overline{Q}^{(1,3)}_{i,j}`$, given the other three.  Simply use the `from B*`
type for the missing integral, as in
```xml
<Q11 type="from B*"/>
```
and provide concrete types for the other three.

#### from C*
<a id="collision_types_from_C"></a>

Uses relationship $`C^{*}_{ij} = \overline{Q}^{(1,2)}_{i,j} / \overline{Q}^{(1,1)}_{i,j}`$
to compute either $`C^{*}_{ij}`$, $`\overline{Q}^{(1,1)}_{i,j}`$, or $`\overline{Q}^{(1,2)}_{i,j}`$, given
the other two.  Simply use the `from C*` type for the missing integral, as in
```xml
<Q11 type="from C*"/>
```
and provide concrete types for the other two.

#### Langevin
<a id="collision_types_langevin"></a>

The Langevin (polarization) potential has been used extensively for modeling
ion-neutral interactions and represents a special case of the inverse power
potential.  A closed form analytical solution of the collision integral using
this potential is given as
```math
\overline{Q}^{(l,s)}_{i,j} = C^{(l,s)} z \pi \sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{T}},
```
where $`C^{(l,s)}`$ is a constant depending on $`l`$ and $`s`$, $`z`$ is
the elementary charge of the ion, and $`\alpha`$ is the dipole polarizability
of the neutral. An example is given in the following code snippet.
```xml
<Q11 type="Langevin">
```
Note that the values of $`l`$ and $`s`$ are automatically determined from the
kind of integral (in this case `Q11`) and $`z`$ is determined from the interaction
pair that the integral is assigned to.  The dipole polarizability of the neutral
must be provided in a [polarizability table](#collisions_polarizabilities)
somewhere in the database.

#### Murphy
<a id="collision_types_murphy"></a>

Implements Eq. (5) of [Murphy (1995)](bibliography.md#Murphy1995) for combining elastic and inelastic
interactions, where
```math
\overline{Q}_{ij}^{(l,s)}(T) = \sqrt{Q_1(T)^2 + Q_2(T)^2}
```
where $`Q_1`$ and $`Q_2`$ are the elastic and
inelastic parts.  This combination rule is often used for ion-parent
interactions where charge exchange interactions become important.  The XML format is
as follows.
```xml
<Q11 type="Murphy">
    <Q1 type="Bruno-Eq(11)">
        46.68783791  -0.33303803   4.25686770  -2.03851201
        14.98170958   8.59618369  -1.65616736 </Q1>
    <Q2 type="Bruno-Eq(17)">
        6.3544e+01 -5.0093e+00  9.8797e-02 </Q2>
</Q11>
```
Note that the types of `Q1` and `Q2` can be any valid collision integral type.

#### Pirani
<a id="collision_types_pirani"></a>

The phenomenological Pirani potential has been introduced in [Pirani et al. (2004)](bibliography.md#Murphy1995),
taking the form
```math
\phi = \epsilon_0 \big[ \frac{m}{n(x)-m} \big(\frac{1}{x}\big)^{n(x)} -
\frac{n(x)}{n(x)-m} \big(\frac{1}{x}\big)^{m} \big],
```
where $`x = r/r_e`$ and $`n(x) = \beta + 4x^2`$. For neutral-neutral and
ion-neutral interactions, m has the value of 6 and 4, respectively.  The value
of $`\beta`$ ranges from 6 to 10 depending on the "hardness" of the the
interacting electronic distribution densities and can be estimated as
```math
\beta = 6 + \frac{5}{s_1 + s_2},
```
where $`s_1`$ and $`s_2`$ are the softness values of the colliding partners
1 and 2.  This is defined as the cubic root of the dipole polarizabilities of
the two species.  The remaining parameters, $`r_e`$ and $`\epsilon_0`$ must
be either fit to match experimental observations or estimated based on correlations.
Both options are available:
```xml
<!-- Option 1: provide necessary parameters -->
<Q11 type="Pirani" beta="7.2644" eps0="0.00798" re="3.621" />

<!-- Option 2: estimate parameters
<Q11 type="Pirani" />
```
[Laricchiuta et al. (2007)](bibliography.md#Laricchiuta2007) provide the necessary correlation
formulas for determining the missing parameters if option 2 is chosen.  The
correlations rely on needing the [dipole polarizabilities](#collisions_polarizabilities)
of the interacting species and, for neutral-neutral interactions, the
[effective electrons](#collisions_effective_electrons) contributing to the
polarization of the neutral species.

Curve-fits of the collision integrals computed using the Pirani potential have
been provided in [Laricchiuta et al. (2007)](bibliography.md#Laricchiuta2007).
These are used to evaluate collision integrals using this potential,
automatically taking into account the type of interaction and integral.

#### ratio
<a id="collision_types_ratio"></a>

Use a ratio of another defined collision integral.
```xml
<Q22 type="ratio" ratio="1.1" integral="Q11" />
```
The XML syntax takes an integral name and the ratio to multiply that integral by. In this
case `Q22` will be computed as 1.1 times `Q11`.

#### table
<a id="collision_types_table"></a>

Interpolates tabulated collision integral data.  The table is provided in XML as two
space delimited lists, separated by a comma.
```xml
<Q11 type="table" units="K,Å-Å" interpolator="l=Linear" clip="yes">
    1000  2000  4000  5000  6000  8000 10000 15000 20000,
    0.12  0.19  0.43  0.55  0.66  0.89  1.12  1.68  2.23
</Q11>
```
The first list indicates the temperature points and the second the collision integral
values, with the units specified by the units attribute.  The `interpolator`
attribute specifies which interpolator is used to interpolate on the table.  By
default, `Linear` is used if no interpolator is specified.  `Chebyshev` and
`MonotoneCubic` may also be used.  The `clip` attribute specifies whether or not to
clip the collision integral at the bounds of the table.  By default this is `yes`.

#### warning
<a id="collision_types_warning"></a>

Uses a constant value for the integral and prints a warning message.  This can be
used when no data is available for a given species pair and kind of integral, without
crashing.
```xml
<Q11 type="warning" value="1.0e-20"/>
```

### Specifying default behavior
<a id="collisions_defaults"></a>

Specifying collision integral data for every collision pair in your mixture may
sound like a daunting task.  Chances are that most of the integrals you
need are already provided in the database.  For the ones that aren't available
already, the database provides a facility to specify default behavior by
specifying the `defaults` node.
```xml
<!-- Default collision integral data -->
<defaults>
    <!-- Neutral-Neutral interactions -->
    <neutral-neutral>
        <!-- Collision integral definitions -->
    </neutral-neutral>

    <!-- Ion-Neutral interactions -->
    <ion-neutral>
        <!-- Collision integral definitions -->
    </ion-neutral>

    <!-- Electron-Neutral interactions -->
    <electron-neutral>
        <!-- Collision integral definitions -->
    </electron-neutral>

    <!-- Charged interactions -->
    <charged>
        <!-- Collision integral definitions -->
    </charged>
</defaults>
```

The `defaults` node allows the user to configure how to provide default
collision integrals for missing data, based on the four general types of
interactions: neutral-neutral, ion-neutral, electron-neutral, and charged.
Whenever the user requests to load a specific integral, the library will first
search the database for the explicit collision pair/integral kind requested. If
the pair or integral type is not found explicitly, the library will then resort
to the default integral provided in `defaults`, according to the type of
interaction specified by the pair.  This approach has several benefits:
- The default behavior is self-documenting and easily tunable without writing
new code or recompiling the library
- Complex expressions can be created to find the most accurate collision model
when data is missing
- No extra work is required to add new species pairs if the default behavior is
good enough.

This last point is particularly valid in the case of charged interactions, for
which the screened Coulomb potential is nearly always a valid approximation.
Therefore, all charged interaction pairs can be supported easily by setting
```xml
<defaults>
    <!-- Charged interactions -->
    <charged>
        <Q11 type="Debye-Huckel"/>
        <Q12 type="Debye-Huckel"/>
        <Q13 type="Debye-Huckel"/>
        <Q13 type="Debye-Huckel"/>
        <Q14 type="Debye-Huckel"/>
        <Q15 type="Debye-Huckel"/>
        <Q22 type="Debye-Huckel"/>
        <Q23 type="Debye-Huckel"/>
        <Q24 type="Debye-Huckel"/>
        <Ast type="Debye-Huckel"/>
        <Bst type="Debye-Huckel"/>
        <Cst type="Debye-Huckel"/>
    </charged>

    <!-- Other interactions -->
</defaults>
```
Other cases can be envisaged as well.  For example, using the
[Langevin](#collision_types_langevin) model as default for all ion-neutral
interactions means that only the [dipole polarizability](#collisions_polarizabilities)
of the neutral species needs to be specified to add a new ion-neutral pair.


### Global options
<a id="collisions_global_options"></a>

The `global-options` node specifies options that act on the whole collision
integral database.  For the moment, there are only two options that can be set.
```xml
<global-options>
    <tabulate Tmin="100" Tmax="50000" dT="100" />
    <integral type="table" interpolator="Linear" clip="true"/>
</global-options>
```

The `tabulate` option instructs the database manager to tabulate all collision
integrals after loading them.  The temperature grid used in the tabulation is
specified through the `Tmin`, `Tmax`, and `dT` attributes which are the minimum
and maximum temperatures, and the constant temperature spacing, respectively.

The second option shown, `integral`, is used to specify global options for a
specific collision integral type.  In the example, the default `interoplator`
and `clip` attributes for all [table](#collision_types_table) collision
integrals are set to `Linear` and `true` respectively.  Note that for the moment,
only attributes of [table](#collision_types_table) can be specified in this
way.

### Species data
<a id="collisions_species_data"></a>

Some of the collision integral models detailed above require additional information
about individual species, such as their dipole polarizabilities.  These parameters are
stored in generic XML nodes as children of the root `collisions` element, with the
following general structure.
```xml
<species-property units="some units">
    <species name="some name" value="some value" ref="some reference" units="other units" />
    <species name="some name" value="some value" ref="some reference" />
    <species name="some name" value="some value" ref="some reference" />
</species-property>
```
Here, `species-property` denotes the name of the species property stored in the node.
Default units can be given as shown in the `units` attribute of the `species-property`
node.  The property node then contains child nodes for each individual species for which
data is provided.  Those nodes provide the species `name`, the `value` of the property
for that species, an optional `ref` attribute for attributing a reference for the data,
and the possibility to override the default `units`.

__A note for developers:__ Species properties stored in this
way can be easily found in any child class of `Mutation::Transport::CollisionIntegral` by calling the `Mutation::Transport::CollisionIntegral::loadSpeciesParameter()` function.

#### Dipole polarizabilities
<a id="collisions_polarizabilities"></a>

Species dipole polarizabilities are used as inputs to some collision integral models,
including [Langevin](#collision_types_langevin) and
[Pirani](#collision_types_pirani).  An example listing of dipole polarizabilities
is given below.
```xml
<!-- Dipole Polarizabilities -->
<dipole-polarizabilities units="Å-Å-Å">
    <species name="N"    value="1.10"   ref="Wright2007"/>
    <species name="N2"   value="1.74"   ref="Wright2007"/>
    <species name="NO"   value="1.70"   ref="Wright2007"/>
    <species name="O"    value="0.80"   ref="Wright2007"/>
    <species name="O2"   value="1.58"   ref="Wright2007"/>
</dipole-polarizabilities>
```

#### Number of effective electrons in polarization
<a id="collisions_effective_electrons"></a>

The number of effective electrons in the polarization of a given species is used
in the [Pirani](#collision_types_pirani) collision integral model.  These
values are stored in the species database `effective-electrons`, following the
example below.
```xml
<effective-electrons>
    <species name="C"    value="4.0"   />
    <species name="C2"   value="6.00"  />
    <species name="C2H"  value="8.11"  />
    <species name="C2H2" value="10.00" />
    <species name="C2H4" value="12.00" />
</effective-electrons>
```
The value of the effective electrons for new species can be estimated using the
approach of [Cambi (1991)](bibliography.md#Cambi1991).

## Gas-Surface Interaction
<a id="gsi"></a>

The gas-surface interaction module of Mutation++ is responsible for
treating chemically reacting surfaces in thermochemical non-equilibrium.
With the aim to obtain the appropriate surface boundary conditions
for a chemically reacting gas, the conservation equations on the
interface have to be written. In general, this idea can be applied for several
different categories of interfaces with different phases and materials on each
side. Since this Mutation++ module emphases on gas-surface interaction it is limited
to having gas on one side (underscore g) and a catalytic or ablative solid or liquid
on the other (underscore b). The surface is not simulated, but approximately modeled.
In most of the cases it can be considered
impermeable, or simplistically porous for pyrolysis gases. The interface
can promote chemical reactions or radiate following the Planck's law of radiation
at the surface temperature. The set of balance equations obtained
are solved with respect to the conserved quantities of the gas, i.e. density,
momentum and energy, which are imposed as boundary values for the full Navier-Stokes equations,
or the porous material.

The general procedure to obtain the surface balances is the following.
Assuming steady state on the surface, the time derivative term
is equal to zero. By taking the limit that one dimension of the volume goes to zero, the
three dimensional fluxes reduce to the normal fluxes at the interface while the volume
source terms, such as chemical reactions, go to zero; only the surface sources remain.
Generally, the set of balance equations can be written as:

```math
(\vec{F}_g - \vec{F}_b) \cdot \hat{n} = \Omega_s,
```

where $`\vec{F}`$ are the fluxes from the gas ($`g`$) and the bulk ($`b`$) phases, while
$`\Omega`$ are the source terms associated to the surface ($`s`$) processes.
Only the normal to surface flux component should be considered, denoted by
the inner product of the flux with the surface unit vector, ($`\hat{n}`$).
The specific form of the balance equations for mass and energy will be seen in the following
sections.

### Surface Chemical Production Terms
<a id="surf_chem"></a>

Below the input file when a single catalytic reaction is presented.
Only the recombination of atomic into molecular oxygen is considered
modeled with the $\gamma$ (gamma) model, with reaction probability equal to 1.

```xml
<gsi gsi_mechanism = "phenomenological_mass">

    <surface_properties type = "none" >
    </surface_properties>

    <surface_chemistry>
        <!-- 1 -->
        <reaction type= "catalysis" formula="O + O => O2">
            <gamma_const> O:1. </gamma_const>
        </reaction>
    </surface_chemistry>

</gsi>
```

The $`\gamma`$ model, introduced by Goulard in the late 1950s, is arguably the most popular
way to treat catalysis in the aero-thermodynamics community. It describes catalytic
reactions as macroscopic, non-elementary processes of the form:

```math
\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{A} \to \mathrm{A_2}
```

In order to determine the chemical production term for this kind of catalytic reactions a
probability for recombination $`\gamma`$ is defined for each recombining species A as:

```math
\gamma = F_{rec} / F_{imp},
```

where $`F_{imp}`$ is the flux of species A impinging the surface and
$`F_{rec}`$ is the flux of species recombining at the surface. This probability is
the input parameter for the model. A fully catalytic wall has $`\gamma`$ equal to 1, which
means that all the particles of species A impinging the surface recombine at the wall.
$`\gamma`$ equal to 0 means that no reaction takes place and corresponds
to a non catalytic, or chemically inert wall. Anything between these two extreme cases is a
partially catalytic wall, which is the case for most of the surfaces. When the probability
$`\gamma`$ is defined, the surface chemical source term is determined as:

```math
\begin{align}
\Omega_A &= \gamma m_A F_{imp} \\
\Omega_{A2} &= - \gamma m_A F_{imp}
\end{align}
```

with $`m_A`$ being the mass of species A.

The only parameter that still needs to be defined is the impinging flux on the surface.
When the distribution function of species at the wall is well approximated by a Maxwellian
and there is no temperature slip, the impinging flux, $`F_{imp}`$, is equal to

```math
F_{imp} = n_A \sqrt{\frac{k_B T}{2 \pi m_A}}
```

according to the kinetic theory of gases.

Initially, the gamma model was developed to describe homonuclear reactions,
such as the one presented in above.
Soon, though, it was observed that heteronuclear reactions were also probable
to occur at the wall, which can take the form of

```math
\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B} \to \mathrm{AB},
```

with the chemical rate for the produced molecule AB equal to:

```math
\Omega_{AB}  = - \gamma_{AB} m_A F_{imp,A} - \gamma_{BA} m_B F_{imp,B}.
```

One atom of A recombines with one atom of B on the surface to produce a molecule AB.
In other words the number of atoms of A that recombine into AB should be equal to the number of B
atoms that recombine into AB. This restriction should be explicitly imposed in order to conserve mass:

```math
\gamma_{AB} F_{imp,A} = \gamma_{BA} F_{imp,B}.
```

As a result, in a reaction of this type two gamma recombination coefficients should be defined not
necessarily equal for the two processes, the one activated when the catalytic reaction is limited by the
flux of A atoms and the opposite. In practice the two recombination number fluxes,
$`\gamma_{AB} F_{imp,A}`$ and $`\gamma_{BA} F_{imp,B}`$, are compared and the limiting one
determines which of the two gammas is chosen.

These gamma coefficients cannot take arbitrary values, they should be limited between 0 and 1,
just like in the homonuclear case. When extra catalytic reactions are added,
such as $`\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{A} \to \mathrm{A_2}`$ and $`\mathrm{B} + \mathrm{B} \to \mathrm{B_2}`$,
the gammas should be further constrained
as $`0 \lt \gamma_A + \gamma_{AB} \lt 1`$ and $`0 \lt \gamma_B + \gamma_{BA} \lt 1`$
in order for mass to be conserved. This approach is consistent with similar approaches
considering the catalytic recombination occurring in Martian atmospheres, where O can recombine
into both O2 and CO2 due to catalytic reactions.

An example input file of catalytic reactions in air including the formation of NO can be seen below.

```xml
<gsi gsi_mechanism = "phenomenological_mass">

    <surface_properties type = "none" >
    </surface_properties>

    <surface_chemistry>
        <!-- 1 -->
        <reaction type= "catalysis" formula="N + N => N2">
            <gamma_const> N:.001 </gamma_const>
        </reaction>
        <!-- 2 -->
        <reaction type= "catalysis" formula="O + O => O2">
            <gamma_const> O:.001 </gamma_const>
        </reaction>
        <!-- 3 -->
        <reaction type= "catalysis" formula="N + O => NO">
            <gamma_const> N:.002 O:.003 </gamma_const>
        </reaction>
    </surface_chemistry>

</gsi>
```

It is still unclear which is the proper boundary conditions for the
ions and electrons on the surface. One of the most common model is to
assume full ion recombination on the surface can be expressed as
catalytic reaction with probability 1.
The following example shows how to impose full ion recombination in
Mutation.

```xml
<gsi gsi_mechanism = "phenomenological_mass">

    <surface_properties type = "none" >
    </surface_properties>

An example of ablation model can be seen below.
```xml
<gsi gsi_mechanism = "phenomenological_mass">

#### Carbon Oxidation Model
<a id="coxid"></a>

The first ablation reaction presented above is the oxidation
of the solid carbon by atomic oxygen. The reaction reads as:

```math
\mathrm{C}_b + \mathrm{O} \to \mathrm{CO}
```

and is exothermic, releasing 3.74 eV per molecule produced. Its reaction
rate coefficient is given by defining a recombination probability
$`\gamma_{CO}`$. This probability is an Arrhenius type function of temperature
and is given by the formula:

```math
\gamma_{CO} = 0.63 \exp \left(\frac{-1160~\mathrm{K}}{T} \right).
```

Carbon oxidation with molecular oxygen is also possible
($`\mathrm{C}_b + \mathrm{O_2} \to \mathrm{CO} + \mathrm{O}`$),
but it is often considered as a less significant process.

#### Carbon Nitridation Model
<a id="cnitr"></a>

The second shown in the example is carbon nitridation,

```math
\mathrm{C}_b + \mathrm{N} \to \mathrm{CN}
```

an exothermic reaction with 0.35 eV of energy released per reacting atom.
The reaction rate is given using a constant recombination probability
$`\gamma_{CN}`$ like in the catalytic case.

#### Carbon Sublimation Model
<a id="csubl"></a>

At high temperatures carbon removal from the surface is dominated by phase
change processes like sublimation. The production of C3 is considered here.
It should be noted that this type of reactions are invertible, with formula:

```math
3\mathrm{C}_b \to \mathrm{C_3}
```

The chemical production rate of this reaction is equal to:

```math
\Omega_{C_3} = \beta (\rho_{eq,C_3} - \rho_{C_3}) \sqrt{\frac{k_B T}{2 \pi m}}.
```

The equilibrium partial density of the C3 species is obtained from the
saturated vapor pressure of carbon, which is equal to

```math
p_{sat,C_3} = c \exp \left( \frac{-T_a}{T} \right)
```

with $`\beta`$ being the evaporation coefficient, $`c`$ the pre-exponential coefficient,
and $`T_a`$ the activation temperature.
Even though here only sublimation is presented in the example, evaporation processes
can be considered with the same model.

### Surface Mass Balance
<a id="smb"></a>

#### Surface Mass Balance for Catalytic Surfaces
<a id="smbc"></a>

Heterogeneous catalysis is an important gas-surface interaction phenomenon occurring
during re-entry of vehicles equipped with re-usable thermal protection system. It
describes the recombination of the dissociated atoms in the flow using the thermal
protection system as a catalyst. It is called heterogeneous, because the recombining
species and the catalyst are in a different phase, here gas and solid. The catalyst,
without being consumed, increases the rate of chemical reactions by offering an alternative,
energetically favored path. It is important to note that catalysis does not change the chemical
equilibrium of reactions, since it favors equally both the forward and the backward reaction rates.
This is a constrain that should be respected by the catalytic model chosen.

In hypersonic the recombination reactions that occur on the surface are in general exothermic.
The energy released to the wall is a substantial percentage of the total heat flux experienced
by space vehicles. Not necessarily all of the recombination energy is directly deposited to the
surface. A part of it is used to excite the internal energy of the produced molecules. Another
reason why calculating
the actual heat released on the surface is a complicated task, is that the gas phase chemistry
and diffusion play an important role in determining the overall catalytic rates.
If all of the phenomena above are modeled with accuracy, the re-entry heat load can be predicted
and the size of the thermal protection system can be determined.
The mass balance on a catalytic surface reads:

```math
\vec{j}_i \cdot \hat{n} = \Omega_{cat,i},
```

where one mass balance equation should be solved for each distinct species in the flow.
The equation above states, that the catalytic activity of every species is equal to the diffusion
flux of these species to the surface. This leads as to two cases. In the first one, the rate
with which the chemical species are produced or destroyed at the wall is higher than the rate
they diffuse to the surface while in the second one the opposite happens. The first case is called
diffusion limited, since diffusion is the mechanism controlling the chemical process, while the
opposite is called reaction limited. When a species i is inert at the surface, then its chemical
rate is exactly equal to zero, which at steady state imposes that its net diffusion flux is also zero.
Even though, in principle, these equations could be omitted, since they impose that the mole fractions
of the species in question do not change with respect to the ones in the gas phase, the full system was
chosen to be solved.

#### Surface Mass Balance for Ablative and Catalytic Surfaces
<a id="smbac"></a>

Ablation is the chemical gas-surface interaction phenomenon which occurs on non-reusable thermal
protection systems of re-entry vehicle. The term ablation describes the category of chemical
reactions during which the dissociated atoms in the flow field recombine directly with the
thermal protection system, which by burning protects the vehicle. Contrary to catalysis, this
burning destroys the material itself making it unable for reuse. Not only chemical reactions can
cause the degradation of ablative thermal protection systems. Mechanical removal processes, such
as spallation, can also occur. The particle injected in the flow field due to these phenomena are
not necessarily in a gaseous form and their modeling requires approaches beyond the scope of this
work. The type of chemical reactions studied here are assumed to produce only gaseous species
and occur only the surface of the material. In cases where the material is porous, ablation
processes also in the bulk, such as in the case of pyrolysis.

Taking these ideas in mind, the surface mass balance accounting only for surface reactions becomes:

```math
[\rho_i (\vec{u}_g - \vec{u}_r) + \vec{j}_i - \vec{F}_{b,i} ] \cdot \hat{n} = \Omega_i,
```

with $`\Omega_i = \Omega_{cat,i} + \Omega_{abl,i}`$ and
term $`\vec{F}_{b,i}`$ is the flux of species $`i`$ entering the interface due
to solid process, like pyrolysis and solid-solid chemical reactions.
Just like before, one mass balance equation should be solved for each distinct species in the flow.
It is most of the time reasonable to consider that recession velocity is
orders of magnitude lower than the gas velocity $`\vec{u}_r`$.

### Surface Energy Balance
<a id="seb"></a>

In order to determine the surface temperature a surface energy balance should be solved along
with the mass balances. It takes the form:

```math
[ \rho ( \vec{u}_g - \vec{u}_r ) H + \vec{q}_g - \vec{F}_{b,e} ] \cdot \hat{n} = \Omega_e
```

where $`\vec{q}_g`$ is the heat flux to the gas phase equal to:

```math
\vec{q}_g = -\lambda \nabla T + \sum_i \vec{j}_i h_i.
```

The radiative heat flux can be also included and will be discussed along with the surface
radiation.

Term $`\vec{F}_{b,e}`$ describes the energy exchanged between the interface
and the bulk of the solid and is composed of three contributions: the first one is the
thermal conduction exiting the surface $`\vec{q}_{cond}`$, the second one is the
enthalpy entering the interface due to the movement of the surface with the recession velocity,
$`\vec{u}_r \rho h_s`$ and the third one appears only in cases of
porous material, describing the enthalpy of the solid pyrolysis gases convected in the interface,
denoted as $`\vec{u}_p \rho_p h_p`$. The subscript $`p`$ symbolizes
the pyrolysis gas properties, with the $`\rho_p h_p`$ being actually the
sum $`\sum_i = \rho_i h_i`$ for the pyrolysis gas densities. The surface
enthalpy $`h_s`$ is an input to the code, as an attribute to the surface_properties element.

An example input file for solving both mass and energy balance can be seen below.
```xml
<gsi gsi_mechanism = "phenomenological_mass_energy">

        <!-- 3 -->
        <reaction type= "ablation" formula="3C-b => C3">
            <sublimation vap_coef="0.1" pre_exp="5.19E15" T="90845." />
        </reaction>
        <!-- 4 -->
        <reaction type= "catalysis" formula="N + N => N2">

        </reaction>
    </surface_chemistry>

    <surface_radiation emissivity="0.86" T_env="0."/>
</gsi>
```

The only source term taken into account for the surface energy balance in the
example above is radiation. It is considered by adding a new element with tag
`<surface_radiation/>`. The surface is assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium
at a temperature T emitting energy following the Stefan-Boltzmann law,

```math
\Omega_e = \Omega_{rad} = \epsilon ( \sigma T^4 - \vec{q}_{rad,g})
```

with $`\sigma`$ being the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and $`\epsilon`$ the emissivity
of the surface. $`T_{env}`$ is the surrounding environment temperature which can
be used to simulate the far field radiative heat flux based on the formula
$`\sigma T_{env}^4`$, which replaces the term $`\vec{q}_{rad,g}`$.
This is a relatively bad approximation and, therefore, it is better to be omitted.

In order to obtain the value for the conductive heat flux on the solid,
either a material code should be used or one should at least solve the
energy equation in the solid. Even though these approaches can be very accurate,
in cases where the material has low thermal conductivity or the recession rates
are high, approximate methods can be used, without compromising the accuracy of
the simulations. Such an approximation was adopted here for the modeling of the
conductive heat flux inside the material, the steady-state ablation approach for a
semi-infinite surface. By writing the steady-state energy equation for the solid phase
and integrating over the semi-infinite material, where on one side is the solid
properties at exactly the interface (subscript $`s`$), while on the other, at infinity,
is the virgin material (subscript $`v`$), the steady state heat flux is given by the formula:

```math
\vec{q}_{cond,ss} = -\vec{u}_r (\rho_v h_v - \rho_s h_s).
```

By replacing the formula above in the surface energy balance and after simplifications one gets:

```math
[ \rho ( \vec{u}_g - \vec{u}_r ) H + \vec{q}_g + \vec{u}_r \rho_v h_v ] \cdot \hat{n} = \Omega_e,
```

which is equally valid for both porous and non-porous materials. In order to use the steady state ablation
approximation, the attribute of surface_feature element solid_conduction should be set to steady state.
Instead of inputting the
virgin material density, the ratio between the virgin and surface density minus one is often used,
refered to as
$`\varphi = (\frac{\rho_v}{\rho_s} - 1)`$ and is the attribute
virgin_to_surf_density_ratio in the solid_properties element defaulting to 1.
The enthalpy_virgin can also be an input with default
value equal to 0. Note that these two last options are only necessary when the steady
state assumption for the solid conduction is considered.

When a material solver is available the conductive heat flux should be an input to the
library for increased accuracy. This can be achieved by setting the solid_conduction
surface feature to `input` and the `setSolidCondHeatFlux` function can be invoked.
The option enthalpy_surface should be set in this case, otherwise it is automatically set
to zero.

Note that only one surface balance equation is solved regardless of the thermodynamic
state model. When multi-temperature models are considered for the thermodynamics additional
temperatures should be imposed on the surface. It is often a reasonable assumption to
impose thermal equilibrium at the wall. This is achieved by setting the surface_feature
option surface_in_thermal_equil `true`. If it is `false`, then any additional temperature
beyond translations will be left unchanged, an assumption which can be used to impose an
adiabatic boundary condition for the internal energy modes.

### Using the GSI module
<a id="gsi_example"></a>

In order for Mutation++ to take into account the Gas Surface Interaction
features the gsi_mechanism attribute should be assigned to the gsi
mechanism file.

```xml
<!-- Example mixture file for gsi -->
<mixture gsi_mechanims="name_of_the_gsi_file">
    <!-- Species list -->
    <species>
        ...
    </species>
</mixture>
```

Below an example code of how to use the gas surface interaction features
of Mutation++ is presented.

```cpp
    const int set_state_with_rhoi_T = 1;

    MixtureOptions opts("mixture_name");
    Mixture mix(opts);

    const int iter = 5;
    mix.setIterationsSurfaceBalance(iter);

    // Setting the state and setting up the library
    mix.setState(rhoi_surf.data(), Tsurf.data(), set_state_with_rhoi_T);
    mix.setSurfaceState(rhoiw.data(), Tsurf.data(), set_state_with_rhoi_T);
    mix.setDiffusionModel(xi_edge.data(), dx);
    mix.setGasFourierHeatFluxModel(Tedge.data(), dx); // Only works with energy balance
    // The .data() function returns the pointer at the first element of the data container.

    // Additional Options
    double gas_rad = 0.;
    setGasRadHeatFlux(*gas_rad); // Only called if feature gas_radiation is true
    double solid_cond = 0.;
    setSolidCondHeatFlux(*solid_cond); // Only called if feature solid_cond is set to input

    // Solving the surface Mass Balance and requesting the solution
    mix.solveSurfaceBalance();
    mix.getSurfaceState(rhoiw.data(), Tsurf.data(), set_state_with_rhoi_T);

    // Getting mass blowing rate.
    double mblow;
    mix.getMassBlowingRate(mblow);

    // Getting surface reaction rates.
    mix.getSurfaceReactionRates(wdot.data());

    // Getting number of reactions and surface reaction rates per reaction.
    int m_nr = mix.nSurfaceReactions();
    mix.getSurfaceReactionRatesPerReaction(wdot_reac.data());
```

Note that this example is not supposed to compile or run, but is there to indicate
the most important features of the library.
