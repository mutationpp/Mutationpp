@tableofcontents

The Multicomponent Thermodynamic And Transport properties for
Ionized gases in C++ (Mutation++) library is designed to provided efficient 
algorithms for the computation of various properties important in the fields of
hypersonics and combustion Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) including:
- Thermodynamic properties
- Multicomponent transport properties
- Finite rate chemistry in thermal nonequilibrium
- A highly robust multiphase equilibrium solver

@section manual Manual

The Mutation++ manual is divided into the following sections:
- Section [Installation](@ref installation) describes the installation process including 
  how to verify a successful install
- Section [Input Files](@ref input_files) describes all of the different data files which
  are used in Mutation++
- Section [Tools](@ref tools) lists all of the available tools that come built-in to the 
  Mutation++ package
- Section [Examples](@ref examples) provides several example codes in both C++ and FORTRAN
  which demonstrate key features of the library
- Section [Bibliography](@ref citelist) lists all of the citations used throughout the manual
  and reference documentation
- Section [Unit Tests](@ref tests) documents the unit testing currently performed.

@section developers Developers

Mutation++ was originally developed by __J.B. Scoggins__ at the 
[von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics](https://www.vki.ac.be) and based on its Fortran
predecessor called %Mutation which was developed by [Thierry Magin](https://www.vki.ac.be/aerospacephys).  Mutation++
is continually improved and extended and currently includes contributions from the following
individuals:
- J.B. Scoggins _creator and main developer_
- Laurent Soucasse
- Georgios Bellas-Chatzigeordis
