<!-- 
   This is the species set listed in Appendix C of "Chemical Equilibrium of
   Ablation Materials Including Condensed Species" by C. W. Stroud and Kay L.
   Brinkley (NASA-TN-D-5391, August 1969) minus the silicon species (because we
   don't care about those at the moment) and N2O2, HCO, and COH2 because we 
   don't have data for them.
