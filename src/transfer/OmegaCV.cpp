/**
* The necessary functions for the computation of the  source terms for
* Vibration-Chemistry-Vibration coupling are implemented.
*
* The dissociation of molecules is a procedure which removes energy from the vibrational mode
* of them and re-introduces it as chemical energy of the produced atoms and molecules. In order to accurately determine
* the exact energy lost from the vibrational mode in a dissociation reaction one must use state-to-state models in order to
* account for the fact that not all the vibrational states have the exact same probability to dissociate. Generally, the higher
* vibrational levels have a greater probability to dissociate compared to the lower ones because the latter ones should ladder climb
* before dissociating. Nonetheless, the state-to-state models are not easy to use in a CFD code due to the increase of the computational
* cost. Therefore, one should rely on accurate Boltzmann equilibrium models in order to take into account for this mode of energy transfer.
*
* Taking into account the above, the models for the Vibration-Chemistry-Vibration energy transfer can be generaly placed in to two different categories,
* the non-preferential and the preferential models. In the first category, all the energy states have the same probability to dissociate compared to the
* preferential ones which assume higher probability of dissociation for the higher energy levels. Currently, only the simplest non-preferential model has been
* implemented, but the code gives the opportunity to be extended for more complicated Vibration-Chemistry-Vibration energy transfer models.
