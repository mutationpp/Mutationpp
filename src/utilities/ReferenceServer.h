 * Non-instantiable class which serves up revolving references to objects of 
 * class T.  At start up, an array of size elements is created using the 
 * default constructor of type T and an index initially points to the first
 * object in the array.  The serve() method returns a reference to the object
 * which is next in the list and updates the index counter.  When the counter
 * hits the end of the list, it is reset to zero.  This class is useful when
 * you want to be able to access temporary objects of some type without having
 * to instantiate them over and over.  The size template parameter should be set
 * to the maximum number of objects that could be required simultaneously.
