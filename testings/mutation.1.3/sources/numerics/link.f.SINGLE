c this is the march 30, 1987 version of
c lsode.. livermore solver for ordinary differential equations.
c this version is in double precision.
c
c lsode solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
c systems of first order ode-s,
c     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form,
c     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(neq)) (i = 1,...,neq).
c lsode is a package based on the gear and gearb packages, and on the
c october 23, 1978 version of the tentative odepack user interface
c standard, with minor modifications.

c summary of usage.
c
c communication between the user and the lsode package, for normal
c situations, is summarized here.  this summary describes only a subset
c of the full set of options available.  see the full description for
c details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
c and instructions for special situations.  see also the example
c problem (with program and output) following this summary.
c
c a. first provide a subroutine of the form..
c               subroutine f (neq, t, y, ydot)
c               dimension y(neq), ydot(neq)
c which supplies the vector function f by loading ydot(i) with f(i).
c
c b. next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff.
c stiffness occurs when the jacobian matrix df/dy has an eigenvalue
c whose real part is negative and large in magnitude, compared to the
c reciprocal of the t span of interest.  if the problem is nonstiff,
c use a method flag mf = 10.  if it is stiff, there are four standard
c choices for mf, and lsode requires the jacobian matrix in some form.
c this matrix is regarded either as full (mf = 21 or 22),
c or banded (mf = 24 or 25).  in the banded case, lsode requires two
c half-bandwidth parameters ml and mu.  these are, respectively, the
c widths of the lower and upper parts of the band, excluding the main
c diagonal.  thus the band consists of the locations (i,j) with
c i-ml .le. j .le. i+mu, and the full bandwidth is ml+mu+1.
c
c c. if the problem is stiff, you are encouraged to supply the jacobian
c directly (mf = 21 or 24), but if this is not feasible, lsode will
c compute it internally by difference quotients (mf = 22 or 25).
c if you are supplying the jacobian, provide a subroutine of the form..
c               subroutine jac (neq, t, y, ml, mu, pd, nrowpd)
c               dimension y(neq), pd(nrowpd,neq)
c which supplies df/dy by loading pd as follows..
c     for a full jacobian (mf = 21), load pd(i,j) with df(i)/dy(j),
c the partial derivative of f(i) with respect to y(j).  (ignore the
c ml and mu arguments in this case.)
c     for a banded jacobian (mf = 24), load pd(i-j+mu+1,j) with
c df(i)/dy(j), i.e. load the diagonal lines of df/dy into the rows of
c pd from the top down.
c     in either case, only nonzero elements need be loaded.
c
c d. write a main program which calls subroutine lsode once for
c each point at which answers are desired.  this should also provide
c for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
c by lsode.  on the first call to lsode, supply arguments as follows..
c f      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
c          this name must be declared external in calling program.
c neq    = number of first order ode-s.
c y      = array of initial values, of length neq.
c t      = the initial value of the independent variable.
c tout   = first point where output is desired (.ne. t).
c itol   = 1 or 2 according as atol (below) is a scalar or array.
c rtol   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
c atol   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
c          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
c          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
c             ewt(i) = rtol*abs(y(i)) + atol     if itol = 1, or
c             ewt(i) = rtol*abs(y(i)) + atol(i)  if itol = 2.
c          thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
c          either the absolute error is less than atol (or atol(i)),
c          or the relative error is less than rtol.
c          use rtol = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
c          use atol = 0.0 (or atol(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
c          control.  caution.. actual (global) errors may exceed these
c          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
c itask  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = tout.
c istate = integer flag (input and output).  set istate = 1.
c iopt   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
c rwork  = real work array of length at least..
c             20 + 16*neq                    for mf = 10,
c             22 +  9*neq + neq**2           for mf = 21 or 22,
c             22 + 10*neq + (2*ml + mu)*neq  for mf = 24 or 25.
c lrw    = declared length of rwork (in user-s dimension).
c iwork  = integer work array of length at least..
c             20        for mf = 10,
c             20 + neq  for mf = 21, 22, 24, or 25.
c          if mf = 24 or 25, input in iwork(1),iwork(2) the lower
c          and upper half-bandwidths ml,mu.
c liw    = declared length of iwork (in user-s dimension).
c jac    = name of subroutine for jacobian matrix (mf = 21 or 24).
c          if used, this name must be declared external in calling
c          program.  if not used, pass a dummy name.
c mf     = method flag.  standard values are..
c          10 for nonstiff (adams) method, no jacobian used.
c          21 for stiff (bdf) method, user-supplied full jacobian.
c          22 for stiff method, internally generated full jacobian.
c          24 for stiff method, user-supplied banded jacobian.
c          25 for stiff method, internally generated banded jacobian.
c note that the main program must declare arrays y, rwork, iwork,
c and possibly atol.
c
c e. the output from the first call (or any call) is..
c      y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
c      t = corresponding value of independent variable (normally tout).
c istate = 2  if lsode was successful, negative otherwise.
c          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong mf).
c          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
c          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
c          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
c          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad jacobian
c             supplied or wrong choice of mf or tolerances).
c          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (solution
c             component i vanished, and atol or atol(i) = 0.)
c
c f. to continue the integration after a successful return, simply
c reset tout and call lsode again.  no other parameters need be reset.
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c example problem.
c
c the following is a simple example problem, with the coding
c needed for its solution by lsode.  the problem is from chemical
c kinetics, and consists of the following three rate equations..
c     dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3
c     dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*y2**2
c     dy3/dt = 3.e7*y2**2
c on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial conditions
c y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0.  the problem is stiff.
c
c the following coding solves this problem with lsode, using mf = 21
c and printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.e10.  it uses
c itol = 2 and atol much smaller for y2 than y1 or y3 because
c y2 has much smaller values.
c at the end of the run, statistical quantities of interest are
c printed (see optional outputs in the full description below).

c full description of user interface to lsode.
c
c the user interface to lsode consists of the following parts.
c
c i.   the call sequence to subroutine lsode, which is a driver
c      routine for the solver.  this includes descriptions of both
c      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
c      following these descriptions is a description of
c      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
c      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
c
c ii.  descriptions of other routines in the lsode package that may be
c      (optionally) called by the user.  these provide the ability to
c      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
c      common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
c
c iii. descriptions of common blocks to be declared in overlay
c      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
c      of the problem and continued solution later.
c
c iv.  description of two routines in the lsode package, either of
c      which the user may replace with his own version, if desired.
c      these relate to the measurement of errors.
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c part i.  call sequence.
c
c the call sequence parameters used for input only are
c     f, neq, tout, itol, rtol, atol, itask, iopt, lrw, liw, jac, mf,
c and those used for both input and output are
c     y, t, istate.
c the work arrays rwork and iwork are also used for conditional and
c optional inputs and optional outputs.  (the term output here refers
c to the return from subroutine lsode to the user-s calling program.)
c
c the legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
c initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
c change in input parameters is flagged by istate = 3 on input.
c
c the descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
c
c f      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
c          ode system.  the system must be put in the first-order
c          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
c          of the scalar t and the vector y.  subroutine f is to
c          compute the function f.  it is to have the form
c               subroutine f (neq, t, y, ydot)
c               dimension y(1), ydot(1)
c          where neq, t, and y are input, and the array ydot = f(t,y)
c          is output.  y and ydot are arrays of length neq.
c          (in the dimension statement above, 1 is a dummy
c          dimension.. it can be replaced by any value.)
c          subroutine f should not alter y(1),...,y(neq).
c          f must be declared external in the calling program.
c
c          subroutine f may access user-defined quantities in
c          neq(2),... and/or in y(neq(1)+1),... if neq is an array
c          (dimensioned in f) and/or y has length exceeding neq(1).
c          see the descriptions of neq and y below.
c
c          if quantities computed in the f routine are needed
c          externally to lsode, an extra call to f should be made
c          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
c          if only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use intdy instead.
c
c neq    = the size of the ode system (number of first order
c          ordinary differential equations).  used only for input.
c          neq may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
c          if neq is decreased (with istate = 3 on input), the
c          remaining components of y should be left undisturbed, if
c          these are to be accessed in f and/or jac.
c
c          normally, neq is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
c          as a scalar in this user interface description.  however,
c          neq may be an array, with neq(1) set to the system size.
c          (the lsode package accesses only neq(1).)  in either case,
c          this parameter is passed as the neq argument in all calls
c          to f and jac.  hence, if it is an array, locations
c          neq(2),... may be used to store other integer data and pass
c          it to f and/or jac.  subroutines f and/or jac must include
c          neq in a dimension statement in that case.
c
c y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
c          length neq or more.  used for both input and output on the
c          first call (istate = 1), and only for output on other calls.
c          on the first call, y must contain the vector of initial
c          values.  on output, y contains the computed solution vector,
c          evaluated at t.  if desired, the y array may be used
c          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
c
c          this array is passed as the y argument in all calls to
c          f and jac.  hence its length may exceed neq, and locations
c          y(neq+1),... may be used to store other real data and
c          pass it to f and/or jac.  (the lsode package accesses only
c          y(1),...,y(neq).)
c
c t      = the independent variable.  on input, t is used only on the
c          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
c          on output, after each call, t is the value at which a
c          computed solution y is evaluated (usually the same as tout).
c          on an error return, t is the farthest point reached.
c
c tout   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
c          used only for input.
c
c          when starting the problem (istate = 1), tout may be equal
c          to t for one call, then should .ne. t for the next call.
c          for the initial t, an input value of tout .ne. t is used
c          in order to determine the direction of the integration
c          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
c          scale of the problem.  integration in either direction
c          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
c
c          if itask = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), tout is ignored after
c          the first call (i.e. the first call with tout .ne. t).
c          otherwise, tout is required on every call.
c
c          if itask = 1, 3, or 4, the values of tout need not be
c          monotone, but a value of tout which backs up is limited
c          to the current internal t interval, whose endpoints are
c          tcur - hu and tcur (see optional outputs, below, for
c          tcur and hu).
c
c itol   = an indicator for the type of error control.  see
c          description below under atol.  used only for input.
c
c rtol   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
c          an array of length neq.  see description below under atol.
c          input only.
c
c atol   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
c          an array of length neq.  input only.
c
c             the input parameters itol, rtol, and atol determine
c          the error control performed by the solver.  the solver will
c          control the vector e = (e(i)) of estimated local errors
c          in y, according to an inequality of the form
c                      rms-norm of ( e(i)/ewt(i) )   .le.   1,
c          where       ewt(i) = rtol(i)*abs(y(i)) + atol(i),
c          and the rms-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
c          rms-norm(v) = sqrt(sum v(i)**2 / neq).  here ewt = (ewt(i))
c          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
c          the values of rtol and atol should all be non-negative.
c          the following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
c          rtol and atol, and the corresponding form of ewt(i).
c
c             itol    rtol       atol          ewt(i)
c              1     scalar     scalar     rtol*abs(y(i)) + atol
c              2     scalar     array      rtol*abs(y(i)) + atol(i)
c              3     array      scalar     rtol(i)*abs(y(i)) + atol
c              4     array      array      rtol(i)*abs(y(i)) + atol(i)
c
c          when either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
c          be dimensioned in the user-s calling program.
c
c          if none of the above choices (with itol, rtol, and atol
c          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
c          error controls can be obtained by substituting
c          user-supplied routines for the setting of ewt and/or for
c          the norm calculation.  see part iv below.
c
c          if global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
c          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
c          components of rtol and atol (i.e. of ewt) should be scaled
c          down uniformly.
c
c itask  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
c          input only.  itask has the following values and meanings.
c          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
c             t = tout (by overshooting and interpolating).
c          2  means take one step only and return.
c          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
c             beyond t = tout and return.
c          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
c             t = tout but without overshooting t = tcrit.
c             tcrit must be input as rwork(1).  tcrit may be equal to
c             or beyond tout, but not behind it in the direction of
c             integration.  this option is useful if the problem
c             has a singularity at or beyond t = tcrit.
c          5  means take one step, without passing tcrit, and return.
c             tcrit must be input as rwork(1).
c
c          note..  if itask = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches tcrit
c          (within roundoff), it will return t = tcrit (exactly) to
c          indicate this (unless itask = 4 and tout comes before tcrit,
c          in which case answers at t = tout are returned first).
c
c istate = an index used for input and output to specify the
c          the state of the calculation.
c
c          on input, the values of istate are as follows.
c          1  means this is the first call for the problem
c             (initializations will be done).  see note below.
c          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
c             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
c             parameters except possibly tout and itask.
c             (if itol, rtol, and/or atol are changed between calls
c             with istate = 2, the new values will be used but not
c             tested for legality.)
c          3  means this is not the first call, and the
c             calculation is to continue normally, but with
c             a change in input parameters other than
c             tout and itask.  changes are allowed in
c             neq, itol, rtol, atol, iopt, lrw, liw, mf, ml, mu,
c             and any of the optional inputs except h0.
c             (see iwork description for ml and mu.)
c          note..  a preliminary call with tout = t is not counted
c          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
c          input is done.  (such a call is sometimes useful for the
c          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
c          thus the first call for which tout .ne. t requires
c          istate = 1 on input.
c
c          on output, istate has the following values and meanings.
c           1  means nothing was done, as tout was equal to t with
c              istate = 1 on input.  (however, an internal counter was
c              set to detect and prevent repeated calls of this type.)
c           2  means the integration was performed successfully.
c          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than mxstep
c              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
c              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
c              successful as far as t.  (mxstep is an optional input
c              and is normally 500.)  to continue, the user may
c              simply reset istate to a value .gt. 1 and call again
c              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
c              in addition, the user may increase mxstep to avoid
c              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
c          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
c              of the machine being used.  this was detected before
c              completing the requested task, but the integration
c              was successful as far as t.  to continue, the tolerance
c              parameters must be reset, and istate must be set
c              to 3.  the optional output tolsf may be used for this
c              purpose.  (note.. if this condition is detected before
c              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
c              (istate = -3) occurs instead.)
c          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
c              integration steps.  see written message for details.
c              note..  if the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
c              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
c              the run to stop.
c          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
c              one attempted step, before completing the requested
c              task, but the integration was successful as far as t.
c              the problem may have a singularity, or the input
c              may be inappropriate.
c          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
c              one attempted step, before completing the requested
c              task, but the integration was successful as far as t.
c              this may be caused by an inaccurate jacobian matrix,
c              if one is being used.
c          -6  means ewt(i) became zero for some i during the
c              integration.  pure relative error control (atol(i)=0.0)
c              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
c              the integration was successful as far as t.
c
c          note..  since the normal output value of istate is 2,
c          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
c          also, since a negative input value of istate will be
c          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
c          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
c          calling the solver again.
c
c iopt   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
c          inputs are being used on this call.  input only.
c          the optional inputs are listed separately below.
c          iopt = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
c                   default values will be used in all cases.
c          iopt = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
c
c rwork  = a real working array (double precision).
c          the length of rwork must be at least
c             20 + nyh*(maxord + 1) + 3*neq + lwm    where
c          nyh    = the initial value of neq,
c          maxord = 12 (if meth = 1) or 5 (if meth = 2) (unless a
c                   smaller value is given as an optional input),
c          lwm   = 0             if miter = 0,
c          lwm   = neq**2 + 2    if miter is 1 or 2,
c          lwm   = neq + 2       if miter = 3, and
c          lwm   = (2*ml+mu+1)*neq + 2 if miter is 4 or 5.
c          (see the mf description for meth and miter.)
c          thus if maxord has its default value and neq is constant,
c          this length is..
c             20 + 16*neq                  for mf = 10,
c             22 + 16*neq + neq**2         for mf = 11 or 12,
c             22 + 17*neq                  for mf = 13,
c             22 + 17*neq + (2*ml+mu)*neq  for mf = 14 or 15,
c             20 +  9*neq                  for mf = 20,
c             22 +  9*neq + neq**2         for mf = 21 or 22,
c             22 + 10*neq                  for mf = 23,
c             22 + 10*neq + (2*ml+mu)*neq  for mf = 24 or 25.
c          the first 20 words of rwork are reserved for conditional
c          and optional inputs and optional outputs.
c
c          the following word in rwork is a conditional input..
c            rwork(1) = tcrit = critical value of t which the solver
c                       is not to overshoot.  required if itask is
c                       4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (see itask.)
c
c lrw    = the length of the array rwork, as declared by the user.
c          (this will be checked by the solver.)
c
c iwork  = an integer work array.  the length of iwork must be at least
c             20        if miter = 0 or 3 (mf = 10, 13, 20, 23), or
c             20 + neq  otherwise (mf = 11, 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 24, 25).
c          the first few words of iwork are used for conditional and
c          optional inputs and optional outputs.
c
c          the following 2 words in iwork are conditional inputs..
c            iwork(1) = ml     these are the lower and upper
c            iwork(2) = mu     half-bandwidths, respectively, of the
c                       banded jacobian, excluding the main diagonal.
c                       the band is defined by the matrix locations
c                       (i,j) with i-ml .le. j .le. i+mu.  ml and mu
c                       must satisfy  0 .le.  ml,mu  .le. neq-1.
c                       these are required if miter is 4 or 5, and
c                       ignored otherwise.  ml and mu may in fact be
c                       the band parameters for a matrix to which
c                       df/dy is only approximately equal.
c
c liw    = the length of the array iwork, as declared by the user.
c          (this will be checked by the solver.)
c
c note..  the work arrays must not be altered between calls to lsode
c for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and
c optional inputs, and except for the last 3*neq words of rwork.
c the latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
c available for use by the user outside lsode between calls, if
c desired (but not for use by f or jac).
c
c jac    = the name of the user-supplied routine (miter = 1 or 4) to
c          compute the jacobian matrix, df/dy, as a function of
c          the scalar t and the vector y.  it is to have the form
c               subroutine jac (neq, t, y, ml, mu, pd, nrowpd)
c               dimension y(1), pd(nrowpd,1)
c          where neq, t, y, ml, mu, and nrowpd are input and the array
c          pd is to be loaded with partial derivatives (elements of
c          the jacobian matrix) on output.  pd must be given a first
c          dimension of nrowpd.  t and y have the same meaning as in
c          subroutine f.  (in the dimension statement above, 1 is a
c          dummy dimension.. it can be replaced by any value.)
c               in the full matrix case (miter = 1), ml and mu are
c          ignored, and the jacobian is to be loaded into pd in
c          columnwise manner, with df(i)/dy(j) loaded into pd(i,j).
c               in the band matrix case (miter = 4), the elements
c          within the band are to be loaded into pd in columnwise
c          manner, with diagonal lines of df/dy loaded into the rows
c          of pd.  thus df(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded into pd(i-j+mu+1,j).
c          ml and mu are the half-bandwidth parameters (see iwork).
c          the locations in pd in the two triangular areas which
c          correspond to nonexistent matrix elements can be ignored
c          or loaded arbitrarily, as they are overwritten by lsode.
c               jac need not provide df/dy exactly.  a crude
c          approximation (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do.
c               in either case, pd is preset to zero by the solver,
c          so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by jac.
c          each call to jac is preceded by a call to f with the same
c          arguments neq, t, and y.  thus to gain some efficiency,
c          intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
c          saved in a user common block by f and not recomputed by jac,
c          if desired.  also, jac may alter the y array, if desired.
c          jac must be declared external in the calling program.
c               subroutine jac may access user-defined quantities in
c          neq(2),... and/or in y(neq(1)+1),... if neq is an array
c          (dimensioned in jac) and/or y has length exceeding neq(1).
c          see the descriptions of neq and y above.
c
c mf     = the method flag.  used only for input.  the legal values of
c          mf are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25.
c          mf has decimal digits meth and miter.. mf = 10*meth + miter.
c          meth indicates the basic linear multistep method..
c            meth = 1 means the implicit adams method.
c            meth = 2 means the method based on backward
c                     differentiation formulas (bdf-s).
c          miter indicates the corrector iteration method..
c            miter = 0 means functional iteration (no jacobian matrix
c                      is involved).
c            miter = 1 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
c                      full (neq by neq) jacobian.
c            miter = 2 means chord iteration with an internally
c                      generated (difference quotient) full jacobian
c                      (using neq extra calls to f per df/dy value).
c            miter = 3 means chord iteration with an internally
c                      generated diagonal jacobian approximation.
c                      (using 1 extra call to f per df/dy evaluation).
c            miter = 4 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
c                      banded jacobian.
c            miter = 5 means chord iteration with an internally
c                      generated banded jacobian (using ml+mu+1 extra
c                      calls to f per df/dy evaluation).
c          if miter = 1 or 4, the user must supply a subroutine jac
c          (the name is arbitrary) as described above under jac.
c          for other values of miter, a dummy argument can be used.
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c optional inputs.
c
c the following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
c call sequence.  (see also part ii.)  for each such input variable,
c this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
c location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
c the use of any of these inputs requires iopt = 1, and in that
c case all of these inputs are examined.  a value of zero for any
c of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
c thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
c locations 5 to 10 in rwork and iwork to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
c then set those of interest to nonzero values.
c
c name    location      meaning and default value
c
c h0      rwork(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
c                   the default value is determined by the solver.
c
c hmax    rwork(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
c                   the default value is infinite.
c
c hmin    rwork(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
c                   the default value is 0.  (this lower bound is not
c                   enforced on the final step before reaching tcrit
c                   when itask = 4 or 5.)
c
c maxord  iwork(5)  the maximum order to be allowed.  the default
c                   value is 12 if meth = 1, and 5 if meth = 2.
c                   if maxord exceeds the default value, it will
c                   be reduced to the default value.
c                   if maxord is changed during the problem, it may
c                   cause the current order to be reduced.
c
c mxstep  iwork(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
c                   allowed during one call to the solver.
c                   the default value is 500.
c
c mxhnil  iwork(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
c                   warning that t + h = t on a step (h = step size).
c                   this must be positive to result in a non-default
c                   value.  the default value is 10.
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c optional outputs.
c
c as optional additional output from lsode, the variables listed
c below are quantities related to the performance of lsode
c which are available to the user.  these are communicated by way of
c the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
c except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
c on any successful return from lsode, and on any return with
c istate = -1, -2, -4, -5, or -6.  on an illegal input return
c (istate = -3), they will be unchanged from their existing values
c (if any), except possibly for tolsf, lenrw, and leniw.
c on any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
c as noted below.
c
c name    location      meaning
c
c hu      rwork(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
c
c hcur    rwork(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
c
c tcur    rwork(13) the current value of the independent variable
c                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
c                   current internal mesh point in t.  on output, tcur
c                   will always be at least as far as the argument
c                   t, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
c
c tolsf   rwork(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
c                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
c                   detected (istate = -3 if detected at the start of
c                   the problem, istate = -2 otherwise).  if itol is
c                   left unaltered but rtol and atol are uniformly
c                   scaled up by a factor of tolsf for the next call,
c                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
c                   (the user may also ignore tolsf and alter the
c                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
c
c nst     iwork(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
c
c nfe     iwork(12) the number of f evaluations for the problem so far.
c
c nje     iwork(13) the number of jacobian evaluations (and of matrix
c                   lu decompositions) for the problem so far.
c
c nqu     iwork(14) the method order last used (successfully).

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c part ii.  other routines callable.
c
c the following are optional calls which the user may make to
c gain additional capabilities in conjunction with lsode.
c (the routines xsetun and xsetf are designed to conform to the
c slatec error handling package.)
c
c     form of call                  function
c   call xsetun(lun)          set the logical unit number, lun, for
c                             output of messages from lsode, if
c                             the default is not desired.
c                             the default value of lun is 6.
c
c   call xsetf(mflag)         set a flag to control the printing of
c                             messages by lsode.
c                             mflag = 0 means do not print. (danger..
c                             this risks losing valuable information.)
c                             mflag = 1 means print (the default).
c
c                             either of the above calls may be made at
c                             any time and will take effect immediately.
c
c   call srcom(rsav,isav,job) saves and restores the contents of
c                             the internal common blocks used by
c                             lsode (see part iii below).
c                             rsav must be a real array of length 218
c                             or more, and isav must be an integer
c                             array of length 41 or more.
c                             job=1 means save common into rsav/isav.
c                             job=2 means restore common from rsav/isav.
c                                srcom is useful if one is
c                             interrupting a run and restarting
c                             later, or alternating between two or
c                             more problems solved with lsode.
c
c   call intdy(,,,,,)         provide derivatives of y, of various
c        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
c                             desired.  it may be called only after
c                             a successful return from lsode.
c
c the detailed instructions for using intdy are as follows.
c the form of the call is..
c
c   call intdy (t, k, rwork(21), nyh, dky, iflag)
c
c the input parameters are..
c
c t         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
c             (normally the same as the t last returned by lsode).
c             for valid results, t must lie between tcur - hu and tcur.
c             (see optional outputs for tcur and hu.)
c k         = integer order of the derivative desired.  k must satisfy
c             0 .le. k .le. nqcur, where nqcur is the current order
c             (see optional outputs).  the capability corresponding
c             to k = 0, i.e. computing y(t), is already provided
c             by lsode directly.  since nqcur .ge. 1, the first
c             derivative dy/dt is always available with intdy.
c rwork(21) = the base address of the history array yh.
c nyh       = column length of yh, equal to the initial value of neq.
c
c the output parameters are..
c
c dky       = a real array of length neq containing the computed value
c             of the k-th derivative of y(t).
c iflag     = integer flag, returned as 0 if k and t were legal,
c             -1 if k was illegal, and -2 if t was illegal.
c             on an error return, a message is also written.
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c part iii.  common blocks.
c
c if lsode is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
c must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in..
c   (1) the call sequence to lsode,
c   (2) the two internal common blocks
c         /ls0001/  of length  257  (218 double precision words
c                         followed by 39 integer words),
c         /eh0001/  of length  2 (integer words).
c
c if lsode is used on a system in which the contents of internal
c common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
c declare the above two common blocks in his main program to insure
c that their contents are preserved.
c
c if the solution of a given problem by lsode is to be interrupted
c and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
c or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
c following the return from the last lsode call prior to the
c interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
c internal common blocks, and later restore these values before the
c next lsode call for that problem.  to save and restore the common
c blocks, use subroutine srcom (see part ii above).
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c part iv.  optionally replaceable solver routines.
c
c below are descriptions of two routines in the lsode package which
c relate to the measurement of errors.  either routine can be
c replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  however, since such
c a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
c done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
c (note.. the means by which the package version of a routine is
c superseded by the user-s version may be system-dependent.)
c
c (a) ewset.
c the following subroutine is called just before each internal
c integration step, and sets the array of error weights, ewt, as
c described under itol/rtol/atol above..
c     subroutine ewset (neq, itol, rtol, atol, ycur, ewt)
c where neq, itol, rtol, and atol are as in the lsode call sequence,
c ycur contains the current dependent variable vector, and
c ewt is the array of weights set by ewset.
c
c if the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in ewt(i)
c (i = 1,...,neq) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
c in y(i) to.  the ewt array returned by ewset is passed to the
c vnorm routine (see below), and also used by lsode in the computation
c of the optional output imxer, the diagonal jacobian approximation,
c and the increments for difference quotient jacobians.
c
c in the user-supplied version of ewset, it may be desirable to use
c the current values of derivatives of y.  derivatives up to order nq
c are available from the history array yh, described above under
c optional outputs.  in ewset, yh is identical to the ycur array,
c extended to nq + 1 columns with a column length of nyh and scale
c factors of h**j/factorial(j).  on the first call for the problem,
c given by nst = 0, nq is 1 and h is temporarily set to 1.0.
c the quantities nq, nyh, h, and nst can be obtained by including
c in ewset the statements..
c     double precision h, rls
c     common /ls0001/ rls(218),ils(39)
c     nq = ils(35)
c     nyh = ils(14)
c     nst = ils(36)
c     h = rls(212)
c thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
c ycur(nyh+i)/h  (i=1,...,neq)  (and the division by h is
c unnecessary when nst = 0).
c
c (b) vnorm.
c the following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
c root-mean-square norm of a vector v..
c     d = vnorm (n, v, w)
c where..
c   n = the length of the vector,
c   v = real array of length n containing the vector,
c   w = real array of length n containing weights,
c   d = sqrt( (1/n) * sum(v(i)*w(i))**2 ).
c vnorm is called with n = neq and with w(i) = 1.0/ewt(i), where
c ewt is as set by subroutine ewset.
c
c if the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
c value of vnorm suitable for use in the error control in lsode.
c none of the arguments should be altered by vnorm.
c for example, a user-supplied vnorm routine might..
c   -substitute a max-norm of (v(i)*w(i)) for the rms-norm, or
c   -ignore some components of v in the norm, with the effect of
c    suppressing the error control on those components of y.
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c other routines in the lsode package.
c
c in addition to subroutine lsode, the lsode package includes the
c following subroutines and function routines..
c  intdy    computes an interpolated value of the y vector at t = tout.
c  stode    is the core integrator, which does one step of the
c           integration and the associated error control.
c  cfode    sets all method coefficients and test constants.
c  prepj    computes and preprocesses the jacobian matrix j = df/dy
c           and the newton iteration matrix p = i - h*l0*j.
c  solsy    manages solution of linear system in chord iteration.
c  ewset    sets the error weight vector ewt before each step.
c  vnorm    computes the weighted r.m.s. norm of a vector.
c  srcom    is a user-callable routine to save and restore
c           the contents of the internal common blocks.
c  dgefa and dgesl   are routines from linpack for solving full
c           systems of linear algebraic equations.
c  dgbfa and dgbsl   are routines from linpack for solving banded
c           linear systems.
c  daxpy, dscal, idamax, and ddot   are basic linear algebra modules
c           (blas) used by the above linpack routines.
c  d1mach   computes the unit roundoff in a machine-independent manner.
c  xerrwv, xsetun, and xsetf   handle the printing of all error
c           messages and warnings.  xerrwv is machine-dependent.
c note..  vnorm, idamax, ddot, and d1mach are function routines.
c all the others are subroutines.
c
c the intrinsic and external routines used by lsode are..
c dabs, dmax1, dmin1, dfloat, max0, min0, mod, dsign, dsqrt, and write.
c
c a block data subprogram is also included with the package,
c for loading some of the variables in internal common.

c stode performs one step of the integration of an initial value
c problem for a system of ordinary differential equations.
c note.. stode is independent of the value of the iteration method
c indicator miter, when this is .ne. 0, and hence is independent
c of the type of chord method used, or the jacobian structure.
c communication with stode is done with the following variables..
c
c neq    = integer array containing problem size in neq(1), and
c          passed as the neq argument in all calls to f and jac.
c y      = an array of length .ge. n used as the y argument in
c          all calls to f and jac.
c yh     = an nyh by lmax array containing the dependent variables
c          and their approximate scaled derivatives, where
c          lmax = maxord + 1.  yh(i,j+1) contains the approximate
c          j-th derivative of y(i), scaled by h**j/factorial(j)
c          (j = 0,1,...,nq).  on entry for the first step, the first
c          two columns of yh must be set from the initial values.
c nyh    = a constant integer .ge. n, the first dimension of yh.
c yh1    = a one-dimensional array occupying the same space as yh.
c ewt    = an array of length n containing multiplicative weights
c          for local error measurements.  local errors in y(i) are
c          compared to 1.0/ewt(i) in various error tests.
c savf   = an array of working storage, of length n.
c          also used for input of yh(*,maxord+2) when jstart = -1
c          and maxord .lt. the current order nq.
c acor   = a work array of length n, used for the accumulated
c          corrections.  on a successful return, acor(i) contains
c          the estimated one-step local error in y(i).
c wm,iwm = real and integer work arrays associated with matrix
c          operations in chord iteration (miter .ne. 0).
c pjac   = name of routine to evaluate and preprocess jacobian matrix
c          and p = i - h*el0*jac, if a chord method is being used.
c slvs   = name of routine to solve linear system in chord iteration.
c ccmax  = maximum relative change in h*el0 before pjac is called.
c h      = the step size to be attempted on the next step.
c          h is altered by the error control algorithm during the
c          problem.  h can be either positive or negative, but its
c          sign must remain constant throughout the problem.
c hmin   = the minimum absolute value of the step size h to be used.
c hmxi   = inverse of the maximum absolute value of h to be used.
c          hmxi = 0.0 is allowed and corresponds to an infinite hmax.
c          hmin and hmxi may be changed at any time, but will not
c          take effect until the next change of h is considered.
c tn     = the independent variable. tn is updated on each step taken.
c jstart = an integer used for input only, with the following
c          values and meanings..
c               0  perform the first step.
c           .gt.0  take a new step continuing from the last.
c              -1  take the next step with a new value of h, maxord,
c                    n, meth, miter, and/or matrix parameters.
c              -2  take the next step with a new value of h,
c                    but with other inputs unchanged.
c          on return, jstart is set to 1 to facilitate continuation.
c kflag  = a completion code with the following meanings..
c               0  the step was succesful.
c              -1  the requested error could not be achieved.
c              -2  corrector convergence could not be achieved.
c              -3  fatal error in pjac or slvs.
c          a return with kflag = -1 or -2 means either
c          abs(h) = hmin or 10 consecutive failures occurred.
c          on a return with kflag negative, the values of tn and
c          the yh array are as of the beginning of the last
c          step, and h is the last step size attempted.
c maxord = the maximum order of integration method to be allowed.
c maxcor = the maximum number of corrector iterations allowed.
c msbp   = maximum number of steps between pjac calls (miter .gt. 0).
c mxncf  = maximum number of convergence failures allowed.
c meth/miter = the method flags.  see description in driver.

c subjected to lu decomposition in preparation for later solution
c of linear systems with p as coefficient matrix. this is done
c by dgefa if miter = 1 or 2, and by dgbfa if miter = 4 or 5.

c         wm also contains the following matrix-related data..
c         wm(1) = sqrt(uround), used in numerical jacobian increments.
c         wm(2) = h*el0, saved for later use if miter = 3.
c iwm   = integer work space containing pivot information, starting at
c         iwm(21), if miter is 1, 2, 4, or 5.  iwm also contains band
c         parameters ml = iwm(1) and mu = iwm(2) if miter is 4 or 5.

c this version is in double precision.
c
c all arguments are input arguments.
c
c msg    = the message (hollerith literal or integer array).
c nmes   = the length of msg (number of characters).
c nerr   = the error number (not used).
c level  = the error level..
c          0 or 1 means recoverable (control returns to caller).
c          2 means fatal (run is aborted--see note below).
c ni     = number of integers (0, 1, or 2) to be printed with message.

c nr     = number of reals (0, 1, or 2) to be printed with message.
c r1,r2  = reals to be printed, depending on nr.
c
c note..  this routine is machine-dependent and specialized for use
c in limited context, in the following ways..
c 1. the number of hollerith characters stored per word, denoted
c    by ncpw below, is a data-loaded constant.
c 2. the value of nmes is assumed to be at most 60.
c    (multi-line messages are generated by repeated calls.)
c 3. if level = 2, control passes to the statement   stop
c    to abort the run.  this statement may be machine-dependent.
c 4. r1 and r2 are assumed to be in double precision and are printed
c    in d21.13 format.
c 5. the common block /eh0001/ below is data-loaded (a machine-
c    dependent feature) with default values.
c    this block is needed for proper retention of parameters used by
c    this routine which the user can reset by calling xsetf or xsetun.
c    the variables in this block are as follows..
c       mesflg = print control flag..
c                1 means print all messages (the default).
c                0 means no printing.
c       lunit  = logical unit number for messages.
c                the default is 6 (machine-dependent).
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c the following are instructions for installing this routine
c in different machine environments.
c
c to change the default output unit, change the data statement
c in the block data subprogram below.
c
c for a different number of characters per word, change the
